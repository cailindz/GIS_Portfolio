To create the customized map above, I walked through the following steps:
1. Use the [ArcGIS Vector Tile Style Editor](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/vtseditor/en/#/styles) to edit the colors and styles of the Mid-Century base map. 
2. Implement a custom color palette generated from the Kraken logo, using a Canva tool.
3. Creating a map in ArcGIS Online, using the custom basemap
4. Adding an existing point feature layer.
5. Uploading a custom icon to symbolize the feature layer.
6. Use the Esri Experience Builder to create an embeddable web map.
7. Embed the map in this GitHub page. 

This process is a quick way to make a big visual impact. Using custom colors and icons will be useful for creating branded map content in the future. There are a lot of options and opportunities for customization, so I could spend as much or as little time as I'd like when producing future custom base maps. One thing I'm interested in doing is customziing which features appear on the map, based on the needed context of the end user.
